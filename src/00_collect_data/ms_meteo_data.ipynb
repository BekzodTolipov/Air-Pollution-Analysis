    "POWER stands for Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources and the goal of the project is to provide solar & meterorological data from NASA research for support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency, & agricultural needs."

    "The meteorological data/parameters in POWER are **space-based** and come from two models: \n",
    "* [(GMAO MERRA-2)](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/) that stands for the Goddard’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications\n",
    "* [GEOS 5.12.4](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/geos_system_news/2016/FP-IT_NRT_G5.12.4.php): GMAO Forward Processing – Instrument Teams (FP-IT) Near Real Time (NRT) products. \n",
    "The difference between two models is that MERRA-2 is better postprocessed, but not available for the last 1-2 months. Wildfires data covers a range from from July 2020 to January 2023, so probably s couple of the most recent observations came from GEOS FP-IT model because the meteorological data was queried on 01-02-2023.\n",

    "POWER data has global coverage and organized as a grid:\n",
    "* For the meteorological datasets spatial resolutions (grid cell size) are ½° latitude by ⅝° longitude (~50 km)\n",
